    The pawn formation is possible to reach (e.g in case of multiple pawns in a single col,
    there must be enough enemy pieces missing to make that formation), here are some useful rules:
    1. it is impossible to have more than 6 pawns in a single file (column)
       (because pawns can't exist in the first and last ranks)
    2. the minimum number of enemy missing pieces to reach a multiple pawn in a
       single col B to G 2=1, 3=2, 4=4, 5=6, 6=9 ___ A and H 2=1, 3=3, 4=6, 5=10, 6=15,
       for example, if you see 5 pawns in A or H, the other player must be missing at least 10 pieces
       from his 15 captureable pieces
    3. if there are white pawns in a2 and a3, there can't legally be one in b2,
       and this idea can be further expanded to cover more possibilities

    Look for bishops in the first and last ranks (rows) trapped by pawns that haven't moved, for example:
    1. a bishop (any color) trapped behind 3 pawns
    2. bishop trapped behind 2 non-enemy pawns (not by enemy pawns because we can reach that position by underpromoting pawns,
       however if we check the number of pawns and extra_pieces we could determine if this case is possible or not)

  //* non-jumpers

  /*
    (Avoid this if you want to validate Fisher's Chess960) If there are non-jumpers enemy pieces in between the king and rook and
    there are still some pawns without moving; check if these enemy pieces could have legally gotten in there. Also, ask yourself:
    was the king or rook needed to move to generate that position? (if yes, we need to make sure the castling abilities reflect this)
    If all 8 pawns are still in the starting position, all the non-jumpers must not have left their initial rank (also non-jumpers enemy pieces can't possibly have entered legally),
    there are other similar ideas, like if the white h-pawn moved once, the rooks should still be trapped inside the pawn formation, etc.
